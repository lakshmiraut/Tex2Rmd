# Tex2Rmd

A package to covert LaTex document to Rmarkdown format for further processing and then to convert into html, Microsoft Word or back to LaTex format. 

# Introduction {#sec1}
This article uses bits and pieces Latex contents from my own papers to illustrate features of this package. The binaries are given for windows (32bit should also work for 64bit and Linux 64bit). It is important to *emphasize* in bold text **NOT ALL** features involving complex formatting codes can be converted.  It incorporates the basic minimum features that are generally used in a Ph.D. thesis, scientific article or a book. See this footnote^[It does not convert latex tables completely. This verion of the software only creates a template for table with caption and label, you need to fill in the details in Rmarkdown document.] for limitations on converting Latex table environment.
