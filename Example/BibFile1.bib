  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in machine learning have made significant contributions to drug discovery. Deep neural networks in particular have been demonstrated to provide significant boosts in predictive power when inferring the properties and activities of small-molecule compounds (Ma, J. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 263–274). However, the applicability of these techniques has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this work, we demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used to significantly lower the amounts of data required to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications. We introduce a new architecture, the iterative refinement long short-term memory, that, when combined with graph convolutional neural networks, significantly improves learning of meaningful distance metrics over small-molecules. We open source all models introduced in this work as part of DeepChem, an open-source framework for deep-learning in drug discovery (Ramsundar, B. deepchem.io. https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem, 2016).},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper formulates a structural dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural parameters of the model using the NLSY79 data. The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills, which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function, by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right-hand side, overestimates the rate of return to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within generation earnings distribution, intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility. The paper finds that a tax-financed free preschool program for the children of poor socioeconomic status generates positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings, higher intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility.},

  Abstract                 = {The growing income inequality has been a big concern for economists and policy makers around the world. Many factors are responsible for the observed burgeoning income inequality, such as capital outflow, relocation of jobs, declining labor union, i.e., declining bargaining power of the labor, poor regulation of financial institutions, corruption, and all-encompassing globalization. Incomes of the bottom 99 percent population in a society comes mainly from earnings, and much of the earnings inequality results from the inequality of skill formation. The children of poor socioeconomic status stays behind skill accusations as compared to their rich counterpart. In modern technology-rich economies, providing high quality education to the talented individuals and matching their jobs with the highly productive technical sector is crucial for economic growth, earnings inequality and social mobility. Because education is used as a signal for a worker’s unobserved endowment of talents, its acquisition by various social groups distorts productive efficiency, lowers social mobility and increases earnings inequality. This paper provides a signaling equilibrium framework to study these issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Children from disadvantaged families perform very poorly in school and labour market because they acquire low level of social, motivational and cognitive skills during their early childhood development. Using the NLSY data set, this paper formulates and then estimates the production processes for cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills such as social and motivational skills during early childhood development and the long-term effects of these skills on learning and lifetime earnings of an individual. Using these estimated relationships, the paper provides a calibrated intergenerational altruistic model of parental investment in children’s preschool. This dynamic model is then used to estimate the effects of publicly provided preschool to the children of poor socioeconomic status (SES) as a social contract on lifetime earnings distribution, intergenerational college and social mobility, and to estimate the tax burden of such a social contract.},
